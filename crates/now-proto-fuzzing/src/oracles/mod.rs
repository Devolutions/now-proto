//! Oracles.
//!
//! Oracles take a test case and determine whether we have a bug. For example,
//! one of the simplest oracles is to take a RDP PDU as our input test case,
//! encode and decode it, and (implicitly) check that no assertions
//! failed or segfaults happened. A more complicated oracle might compare the
//! result of two different implementations for the same thing, and
//! make sure that the two executions are observably identical (differential fuzzing).
//!
//! When an oracle finds a bug, it should report it to the fuzzing engine by
//! panicking.
